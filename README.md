Repository of Obsidian theme(s), snippets and scripts I personally use, in case anyone finds them useful. 

I try to minimize my use of plugins, as I don't want to be dependent on something that might not be updated with new versions of obsidian. I do rely on [Obsidian Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) for my templates.
